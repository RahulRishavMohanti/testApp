  <h4>About the Lessons</h4>

<p>In these lessons, you'll be building a simple meal-tracking app called FoodTracker. This app shows a list of meals, including a meal name, rating, and photo. A user can add, remove, or edit a meal. To add a new meal or edit an existing one, users navigate to a different screen where they can specify a name, rating, and photo for a particular meal.</p>

<h2>  Build a Basic UI</h2>
<p>
This lesson gets you familiar with Xcode, the tool you use to write apps. You'll become familiar with the structure of a project in Xcode and learn how to navigate between and use basic project components. In the lesson, you'll start making a simple user interface (UI) for the FoodTracker app and view it in the simulator. When you're finished, your app will have a label for the meal’s name, a text field to change the meal's name, and a button for resetting the name.
